# genetic-algorithm_arithmetic-puzzle
This repository contains code for applying a genetic algorithm metaheuristic to find the best sequence of arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on a given set of six integer numbers to achieve a target value. The goal is to optimize the expression to get as close as possible to the target value.
